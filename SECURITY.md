### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue, instead send your report privately to _security@docker.com_.

Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it, although we will keep your name confidential if you request it. We also like to send giftsâ€”if you're into swag, make sure to let us know. We currently do not offer a paid security bug bounty program, but are not ruling it out in the future.
